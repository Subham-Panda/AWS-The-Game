# Cloud: The Game ☁️

**Architect. Scale. Survive.**

A high-fidelity 3D simulation game where you architect resilient cloud infrastructure. Scale from a garage startup to a global tech giant while defending against massive traffic spikes, DDoS attacks, and chaotic failures.

## 🎮 Features



### 🏗️ 3D Infrastructure Builder
*   **Drag & Drop**: Build using **Gateways, Load Balancers, Web Servers, Mult-AZ Databases, and Redis Caches**.
*   **Visual Logic**: Watch colored packets (Blue=Legit, Red=Malicious) flow through your system in real-time.
*   **Physics-based Interaction**: Connect nodes dynamically with realistic cabling.

### 🚦 Realistic Simulation
*   **Smart Routing**: Traffic flows logically (Gateway -> LB -> Server -> DB).
*   **Bottlenecks**: Overloaded nodes slow down and crash.
*   **Cost Management**: Manage your burn rate against revenue from successful requests.
*   **Reputation System**: Failures damage your company's reputation. Don't hit 0%.

### 🎯 Scenarios & Challenges
*   **The Startup**: Learn the basics with limited funding.
*   **Black Friday**: Survive a massive spike in e-commerce traffic.
*   **DDoS Defense**: Mitigate targeted cyber attacks using WAFs.
*   **Chaos Engineering**: Test your resilience against random node failures.
*   **Sandbox**: Build freely with unlimited resources.

### 🔬 Research & Development
*   **Tech Tree**: Unlock advanced capabilities like **Auto-Scaling**, **Multi-AZ Resilience**, and **Global CDNs**.
*   **Progression**: Earn **Research Points (RP)** to upgrade your stack.
